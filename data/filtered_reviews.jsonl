{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Nice phone, but slippery and expensive to replace the front glass", "text": "We just upgraded from our old S7's to these S20's.  Love the additional power of the phone, the battery life is easily double the old S7 (even with more frequent use during the day than what we typical did on our S7's).  Screen resolution is super, camera is great.<br /><br />The things we didn't like are:<br />- the phone is slippery, especially with the curved front glass on the long edges of the phone<br />- the slim/lightweight style phone cases that protected the S7 won't protect the front glass on the S20, so you either have to never drop your phone, or you have to get a heavy, bulky phone case, which kinda defeats the purpose of having a thin, lightweight phone<br />- depending  on how you're holding the phone, the curved edge can allow the phone to think that your holding fingers are actually trying to touch the screen and get interpreted as finger presses, which can lead to unexpected things happening on the screen or no action at all when you try to press a screen button or scroll with your other hand (because nothing happens since the phone thinks your holding finger is doing something).  So you have to hold the phone the 'right way' to make sure the screen works.  Unlike Steve Jobs, I don't think you should have to hold your phone a 'certain' way in order for it to work correctly.<br />- The curved edges make the front glass easy to shatter if you drop it front-glass down  (see attached pic).  Even with this little damage to the screen, the screen is half white, which makes the phone completely non-functional.<br />- It costs *more* to replace the screen than to buy a new phone (as of 10/26/22, screen replacement is $270, and the new phone with tax is $230).<br />- The phone doesn't support a micro-sd card.<br />- The phone doesn't have the nifty blinking blue/red/green LED on the S7 that let you know if you had a missed call, notification, or low battery.  I miss that feature.<br /><br />So, while it is a great phone and screen, the practical issues involved in everyday use fall short.  We can't recommend this phone.<br /><br />We are now looking at the S20 FE, which has a flat screen like the S7, a plastic backside (unlike the S20's glass backside), which we think will be a much better choice for our needs.<br /><br />Note that the S20 FE as a new phone cost less than the S20, but the refurb'd FE's cost more than the refurb'd S20's.  I think this is the marketplace voting that the FE is a better practical phone than the S20 flagship.  And the FE front screen replacement only costs $150, which is a deal since you are much less likely to break the glass on the FE.", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71BmJosa-7L._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71BmJosa-7L._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71BmJosa-7L._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B08BX6WZW1", "parent_asin": "B09HFW8GRB", "user_id": "AHE7TDZKCBZXORD4D57Z73FPIEVA", "timestamp": 1666820315385, "helpful_vote": 28, "verified_purchase": true}

When you buy the \u201cRENEW product\u201d, you have no idea what was the original issue that necessitated the phone return. No way to effectively test to verify that it had been properly repaired. What is the true age of the phone, or the original activation date, which determines your factory warranty. You may not realize the tight return window the seller allows. As in my case miss and it, and you are doomed.  RE CELL was most insensitive and inflexible and they took 5 days to respond with an absolute denial of any help, offer an apology much less help me offset the cost of a replacement. I told them of my personal misfortune, acknowledged my negligence in not realizing the return window, and my inability to prove the functionality of the phone because of me current condition.<br /><br />May 2021 - I paid a total of $513.00 for the \u201crenew\u201d Samsung S-20. I enabled Wi-Fi calling as most carriers suggest. Because of a severe illness I only leave home once per month for chemotherapy. That\u2019s when I discovered that the phone only made calls via the Wi-Fi NOT using the cellular network as it should. After days troubleshooting with my carrier, replacing the SIM card the phone did not work. The local Samsung vendor ultimately diagnosed the issue as a defect with main board. I am in the process of appealing to Samsung to see if I can get any relief. No thanks to RE CELL who could have demonstrated good customer service, by offering me some a reduction on a replacement or the least point me in the direction of alternatives. I am DISAPOINTED with this seller. Hope I can write something more positive about my experience with Samsung's treatment.<br /><br />UPDATE::;;Samsung did right by me.

First, everything about the phone was like new.  No scratches or defects.  Transferred old Samsung phone over to the new phone with only minor updates and sign-ins. As for the phone, my only preference would be for it to be slightly larger (I have fairly broad finger tips and the extra width helps.)  It could also be a little thicker and have a larger battery capacity.  Thin is fine, but usability is more important -  lifecycle before charging needed.  The phone got a little warm during setup when the processor was running continually, but is OK under normal use.  I upgraded for two reasons - ability to screen mirror through an HDMI cable and secondly, to be ready for 5G.  5G is really not very prevalent yet so I am not sure how much this matters.  Thanks to the Smart Switch the transfer went smoothly.

After recently going to the verizon wireless store and viewing the phones, I noticed that they all looked alike. There really is no major differences in the current galaxy phones on the market except  the camera notch and quality of the camera. It really makes no sense to pay a grand for a cell phone when a newer version of the phone is released the following year and the features from GS20, GS21, to GS22 are not drastically different between all of the phones.<br /><br />So, both of the phones I purchased appeared to be brand new, no scratches on the screen , phones were clean and even the backs of both phones were scratch free and intact. I chose to purchase the verizon compatible phone as opposed to an unlocked phone because I do not plan on changing wireless carriers anytime soon. As soon as I got the phone I was able to activate them with no problems and transferred the sim cards. I had service immediately and had no problems.<br /><br />Both phones came with a charging cable and wall plug and sim slot opener. There was a protective film over the screen of the phone and the phones came in small sized box to fit the phone in.

It cost me 20.00 to return it because I wanted someone to have to sign for it for extra protection to make hopefully we would get our money back for the phone. I printed the label and information out and it stated that it would take 2 to 3 days after they received it back to get our refund back. We waited about 2 weeks and didn't see the refund back to our account so I called Amazon to see what was going on. It only took a few hours to see the refund in our account which we were happy about.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Great alternative to paying top dollar for a new device", "text": "I ordered the unlocked version and luckily got a T-Mobile version with dual sim for an external SD and 12GB RAM as I wanted since I heard the Verizon version has less RAM and a single SIM. To start the phone is in \"near\" perfect condition. The only small issues I could find were a tiny imperfection on the screen and some slight OLED burn in at the bottom of the screen where the buttons are. It looks like a small \"P\" with a circle next to it when viewing something on a white background but for the price I'm not too bothered. The phone also did not come with a screen protector but that was an easy fix. Everything I've tested works flawlessly including the battery life (which they guarantee at least 80% capacity).<br /><br />Note for Verizon customers: I activated it on Verizon and swapped in my sim from my old S10 and come to find out 5G appears to work out of the box with no changes to my plan or anything so I'll take it. One annoyance with Verizon is they use their own visual voicemail app that comes pre-loaded on their locked phones. Unfortunately there's no way to install it on an unlocked phone so now I don't get notifications for voicemail and I have to call in to check messages. I even tried sideloading the APK but it doesn't work so not sure if it's possible to fix or not. Kind of annoying atm but maybe that will push me over the fence to switch to another carrier (like one that offers their voicemail app on the playstore - ie pretty much every other carrier).<br /><br />Coming from an S10 that got a white screen of death after a small drop this phone is better in every way and can't be beat at the price. Even mid tier phones cost over 350-400 new and this phone is way superior being a top of the line phone when it launched and half the price. I'm glad I took the plunge and tried a renewed phone since I found my new way to upgrade my phone. No thanks to signing contracts and getting locked into a network. Buying a previous gen phone is the way to go for me for sure.

The packaging was good, there's not a visible scratch in sight on the phone.<br />As far as this seller goes, they did a great job with this phone.<br />So far I've only found a few faults with this phone compared to my s9+.<br />1. Flashlight is not at bright on this phone which I assume will also be a disadvantage while using the flash for pictures.<br />2. There's no power saving mode on this phone? Like at all? The s9+ had at least 2, I don't think I ever used it without the powersave mode on so im not sure how much I'm going to like the battery life on this one. Note, there is some kind of wifi power saver? However, I almost never use wifi so I don't think that's gonna solve my issue.<br />3. The length vs width of the screen is almost awkward. I feel like it should be a little wider but that may just be me missing the size of my s9+ lol. I almost regret not trying the s20 FE but I'm going to try my best to give this phone an honest shot. So far the seller has a 10/10 but the phone itself is a 6/10, maybe a 7/10 if I can take a clear picture of the moon \ud83c\udf19 \ud83e\udd2d<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />Okay, I've had the phone for a week or two now so I decided to come back and address my previous concerns.<br />The battery life on this phone is amazing even without a powersave option. I have no complaints about that at all.<br />The flashlight strength is still on the dim side for me but I'm getting used to it. I have not looked to see how it affects flash in pictures though.<br />I have gotten used to the different size of the screen and I think I will be just fine.<br />Overall I'm very satisfied with the phone. I would have to say it is a solid 8.5/10 compared to my S9+. The seller sits at a 10/10 as I have not found any defects with the phone yet!", "images": [], "asin": "B08HG28N35", "parent_asin": "B09HFW8GRB", "user_id": "AGVVQJIG3N2B56CPDJNCJWTQNGWA", "timestamp": 1673837125044, "helpful_vote": 57, "verified_purchase": true}

Aside from very, very minor marks on 1 side of the phone, it is practically brand new for only $454.", "images": [], "asin": "B08HG28N35", "parent_asin": "B09HFW8GRB", "user_id": "AEBYKY3V7FUR4GNCLVTO2DVXF34A", "timestamp": 1627694472289, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}
